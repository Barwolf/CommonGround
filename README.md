**Common Ground** is a personal, context-aware activity recommendation system designed to bridge the gap between digital fatigue and physical connection. 

The platform acts as an "intelligent social concierge," helping users identify the perfect way to "touch grass" based on their specific needs, social battery, and physical readiness.

## ✨ Key Features
* **"Touch Grass" Notifications:** Proactive alerts triggered by high screen time to encourage outdoor breaks.
* **Context-Aware Logic:** Recommendations change based on weather, time of day, location, and current "social battery."
* **Social Coordination:** Identifies friends with matching availability via Google Calendar to simplify planning.
